# 🧠 React Master File Practice

This repository is my core React playground — a centralized practice lab for learning, testing, and refining every concept in modern React development. All feature experiments, logic trials, and module-based learning are done here first before being extracted into standalone projects.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- To structure my daily learning as a MERN stack developer  
- To explore React concepts through real practice and clean component design  
- To create a version-controlled foundation for all front-end growth

## 📚 Concepts Practiced So Far

### 🔷 React Fundamentals
- JSX and component architecture
- Props and dynamic prop handling
- Controlled components and input binding
- Conditional rendering
- Reusable component patterns

### 🔹 React State Management
- `useState` for dynamic values
- `useEffect` for lifecycle behaviors
- `useReducer` for complex form management
- `useId`, `useRef`, and `forwardRef` for DOM handling
- `useFormState` and `useActionState` for advanced form control

### 🎛️ Form Handling & Validation
- Simple and multi-field form structures
- Validation using regex and error display
- Centralized state handling using reducer logic
- UI feedback for invalid entries
- Action-based state validation for progressive input

### 🛠️ Custom Hooks & Reusability
- Modular custom hooks
- Encapsulation of business logic
- Hook-based component isolation and reuse

### 🧩 API Integration
- GET request from external APIs (`dummyjson.com`)
- POST requests with dynamic backend URLs
- DELETE and PUT requests with JSON Server
- UI feedback and loading states during fetch
- Navigator toggle to switch between POST and FETCH views
- Lazy loading using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`
- Experimental usage of React's `use()` API

### 🎨 Styling
- Internal, external, and modular CSS
- Component-scoped styling
- Form layout and spacing improvements
- Error message UX design

### 🧭 Routing & Navigation
- Route-based component separation
- Conditional navbar rendering
- Navigator components for view switching
- Dynamic routing for editing resources

### 🌐 Context API
- Global state sharing using React Context
- Consumer/Provider setup
- Data flow across nested component trees

## 🚧 Work In Progress

- Refactoring folders based on features
- Improving nested routing structure
- Reusable UI components and hook libraries
- Extracting completed work into polished, single-topic repos

## 💡 Developer Note

This is not a production-ready app. It's my personal development sandbox — where I break, debug, design, and improve everything in React before applying it to full-stack projects.
