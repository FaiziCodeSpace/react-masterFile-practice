# ðŸ“˜ Practice Progress Tracker

This repository is a detailed journal of my MERN Stack learning journey. It tracks every concept Iâ€™ve practiced â€” from front-end development in React.js to back-end logic using Node.js and Express.js. All topics are backed by live, coded repositories built by me.

Each repo listed below focuses on one or more core concepts. This tracker helps clients, recruiters, or collaborators quickly understand the depth and direction of my skillset.

## ðŸ“‚ My Core Practice Folder

> ðŸ”— [`react-masterFile-practice`](https://github.com/FaiziCodeSpace/react-masterFile-practice)

This repo contains all day-to-day React practice. I build everything here first, then move it into dedicated, topic-based repositories after polishing.

ðŸ“Œ Organized into folders like:
- `file-1/` â†’ Props, input handling, form setup  
- `file-2/` â†’ State management, toggle logic, event flow  
- `file-3/` â†’ Styling: Internal, External, CSS Modules  
- `file-4/` â†’ Hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useId, useFormState, useTransition, custom hooks  
- `file-5/` â†’ Array & Object rendering, fragments, derived state  
- `file-6/` â†’ React Router and navbar logic  
- `file-7(API)/` â†’ Real and Mock API Handling  
- `contextAPI/` â†’ Global state with context  
- `CustomHooks/` â†’ Reusable logic & showcases  
- `router/` â†’ Layout-based routing & conditional navbar  

### ðŸ”Œ API Feature Highlights:
- GET request from `https://dummyjson.com/users`  
- Local JSON Server mock API (`http://localhost:3000/users`)  
- Loading spinner with conditional render  
- POST request using `fetch()` and form data  
- URL selector to switch between two backend endpoints  
- Navigator logic to toggle between View List and POST form  
- Delete function to remove user from local state  
- Edit button redirects to editing screen  
- PUT request updates user data with dynamic ID routing  
- Form validation using `useState` and regex  
- Form validation using `useActionState` for progressive form logic  
- Full form state management using `useReducer` hook  
- **RGB color state persisted using `localStorage`**
